# Changelog

All notable changes to IDevelop Community Edition are documented here. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The talent suite is no longer gated by the boot-time `V2_FEATURES=1`: optional
  modules (campaigns, development, talent, mobility, engagement, AI, local
  content) are switched from **Administration → Modules** (`/admin/modules`)
  without a restart, with three adoption stages (framework & assessment, plus
  talent & development, plus engagement & AI) or custom switches. A fresh install
  starts at stage 1; `V2_FEATURES=1` still forces every module on and an install
  started with it is recorded at stage 3. i18n no longer depends on
  `V2_FEATURES`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-29

First public release of **IDevelop Community Edition**.

### Added

- Friendly "Open Horizon" interface (`public/css/horizon.css`): light-first
  Daylight mode and a soft Dusk dark mode, rounded surfaces, pill navigation and
  buttons, gradient page banners, sentence-case labels, no grid texture.
- UX & design committee round 1 (`docs/DESIGN-REVIEW.md`): WCAG 2.2 AA fixes,
  self-hosted brand typeface, "Match device" mode, shared empty states, mobile
  layout fixes, friendlier bilingual copy, fictional demo organisation
  (`npm run db:seed:demo-org`).
- Innovation & business performance committee (`docs/PRODUCT-STRATEGY.md`):
  ESCO taxonomy import, bilingual survey templates, Slack / Teams webhook
  formats, works-council register, "What is recorded about me", EU AI Act
  copilot guardrails, employee growth panels (target-role gap, closest roles,
  suggested learning), manager team roster and team approval, scoped
  recognition.
- UX round 2: getting-started progress, card tables on phones, one filter-bar
  pattern, readiness legends, UK English, localised numbers and manifest.
- Appearance menu in the top bar: light/dark mode and four colour themes (Iris,
  Meadow, Sunrise, Ocean), remembered per browser, all measured WCAG AA.

- New product identity "Open Horizon": logo mark, horizontal logos (dark and
  light), favicons, PWA and Apple icons, social card (`public/brand/`,
  `public/icons/`), Iris / Coral colour system for both themes, Plus Jakarta Sans
  and JetBrains Mono typography, graphic chart in `docs/BRAND.md`.
- "Horizon" data-visualisation palette with measured contrast and
  colour-vision-deficiency separation (`src/utils/branding.js`).
- `src/config/product.js` — the single declaration of the product identity.
- Generic, CC0-licensed starter capability framework (6 pillars, 12 sub-domains,
  34 bilingual skills, 5 role families, 6 sample roles) and
  `npm run db:seed:starter`.
- Language-neutral contracts in `docs/contracts/` (OpenAPI, chart identity,
  product identity) with `npm run contracts:export` and a drift test.
- Documentation for external contributors: `README.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull-request templates.
- Repository-wide guard test that rejects legacy names and leaked personal data
  using hashed tokens.
- CI on PostgreSQL 16 and 17 using the product's own migrator and a
  deterministic seed.
- AI companion for every signed-in user: an "Assistant" tab (first, default) in
  the help panel answers "how do I…", "what should I do next", "explain this
  page" and "what is…" from a bilingual built-in knowledge base
  (`src/config/companionKnowledge.js`) filtered by role and permissions, with no
  language model required. Employees get only their own readiness and to-dos;
  managers' and admins' data questions go through the RBAC-scoped copilot with
  its EU AI Act guardrails. An allowed copilot model may rephrase product-guide
  answers but never receives personal data. `POST /api/companion/ask`,
  `GET /api/companion/suggestions`, admin switch `companion.enabled` (default
  on), audited as `COMPANION_QUERY`.

### Changed

- Licence text: full GNU AGPL v3.0 (`LICENSE`) plus `NOTICE` with trademark and
  third-party attributions.
- Docker image on Node 22 with OCI labels; Compose refuses to start without real
  secrets instead of falling back to insecure defaults.
- Windows packaging no longer bundles a database snapshot unless explicitly
  requested (`-IncludeData`), and its name guard reads an operator-supplied,
  git-ignored denylist.
- Base schema runs on PostgreSQL 16 as well as 17.
- Commit scopes are functional areas instead of internal project phases.

### Security

- SQL console disabled unless `SQL_CONSOLE_ENABLED=1` is set by the operator.
- Copilot: non-EU providers blocked by default; no named-person ranking unless
  enabled.

- Imported administrator accounts no longer receive a shared, publicly known
  default password; they get an unknowable secret and a forced change.
- No credential ships in `installer/config.psd1`.

### Fixed

- Client-side sortable table headers rendered as unstyled browser buttons.
- Pre-existing lint errors and unformatted files that kept CI red.
