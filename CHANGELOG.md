## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-29

First public release of **IDevelop Community Edition**.

### Added

- Friendly "Open Horizon" interface (`public/css/horizon.css`): light-first
  Daylight mode and a soft Dusk dark mode, rounded surfaces, pill navigation and
  buttons, gradient page banners, sentence-case labels, no grid texture.
- Appearance menu in the top bar: light/dark mode and four colour themes (Iris,
  Meadow, Sunrise, Ocean), remembered per browser, all measured WCAG AA.

- New product identity "Open Horizon": logo mark, horizontal logos (dark and
  light), favicons, PWA and Apple icons, social card (`public/brand/`,
  `public/icons/`), Iris / Coral colour system for both themes, Plus Jakarta Sans
  and JetBrains Mono typography, graphic chart in `docs/BRAND.md`.
- "Horizon" data-visualisation palette with measured contrast and
  colour-vision-deficiency separation (`src/utils/branding.js`).
- `src/config/product.js` — the single declaration of the product identity.
- Generic, CC0-licensed starter capability framework (6 pillars, 12 sub-domains,
  34 bilingual skills, 5 role families, 6 sample roles) and
  `npm run db:seed:starter`.
- Language-neutral contracts in `docs/contracts/` (OpenAPI, chart identity,
  product identity) with `npm run contracts:export` and a drift test.
- Documentation for external contributors: `README.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull-request templates.
- Repository-wide guard test that rejects legacy names and leaked personal data
  using hashed tokens.
- CI on PostgreSQL 16 and 17 using the product's own migrator and a
  deterministic seed.

### Changed

- Licence text: full GNU AGPL v3.0 (`LICENSE`) plus `NOTICE` with trademark and
  third-party attributions.
- Docker image on Node 22 with OCI labels; Compose refuses to start without real
  secrets instead of falling back to insecure defaults.
- Windows packaging no longer bundles a database snapshot unless explicitly
  requested (`-IncludeData`), and its name guard reads an operator-supplied,
  git-ignored denylist.
- Base schema runs on PostgreSQL 16 as well as 17.
- Commit scopes are functional areas instead of internal project phases.

### Security

- Imported administrator accounts no longer receive a shared, publicly known
  default password; they get an unknowable secret and a forced change.
- No credential ships in `installer/config.psd1`.

### Fixed

- Client-side sortable table headers rendered as unstyled browser buttons.
- Pre-existing lint errors and unformatted files that kept CI red.
